Credit Card Fraud Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a dataset of transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, the model identifies patterns and anomalies associated with fraudulent activities. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, validation, and deployment planning.

Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for both credit card companies and consumers. This project aims to develop a classification model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The dataset used contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted data quality checks, treated missing values, and handled outliers.
Visualized data to identify patterns, relationships, and trends.
Data Cleaning
Confirmed no missing values were present, hence no data cleaning was required.
Handling Imbalanced Data
Employed Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the highly imbalanced dataset.
Feature Engineering
Created new features and transformed existing ones to enhance model performance.
Model Selection
Selected the most appropriate model based on its performance.
Model Training
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Estimated the best model parameters using the training set.
Model Validation
Evaluated the model's performance on unseen data to assess its ability to generalize.
Identified and addressed issues such as overfitting.
Model Deployment
Developed a plan for deploying the trained model in a production environment.
Results and Performance Evaluation
Achieved an accuracy of over 75% on the test dataset.
Implemented methods for hyperparameter tuning.
Conducted extensive model validation to ensure robustness.
Discussion of Future Work
Address limitations of the current model.
Explore avenues for improving model performance, such as incorporating additional features or experimenting with different algorithms.
